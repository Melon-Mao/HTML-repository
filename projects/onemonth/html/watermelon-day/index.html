                <p>
                    The juicy, refreshing watermelon deserves its own day,
                    that's why we celebrate National Watermelon Day. Cultivation
                    of this fruit dates back to 2000 B.C., with the first
                    watermelon harvest on record occurring approximately 5,000
                    years ago in Egypt. Traces of watermelon and its seeds have
                    been discovered on sites of the 12th Egyptian Dynasty,
                    including in the tomb of King Tutankhamen. Paintings of
                    different types of watermelon have also been found in
                    ancient Egyptian inscriptions.

                <p>
                    The sweet fruit we enjoy today is the result of mutations
                    over the course of a thousand years of cultivation.
                    Watermelon seeds were sold to traders passing through the
                    trade routes in the Kalahari Desert in Africa. From there,
                    the cultivation of the watermelon spread across Africa. The
                    origin of the progenitor of the watermelon was in Africa,
                    after which it spread into Mediterranean countries and other
                    parts of Europe. By the end of the ninth century, watermelon
                    cultivation became common in China and the rest of Asia.

                    According to “The Dictionary of American Food and Drink” by
                    John Mariani, the word 'watermelon' first appeared in the
                    English dictionary in 1615. The watermelon is commonly known
                    as a type of melon, but it is not in the genus Cucumis. The
                    outer rind of a watermelon is dark green with yellow stripes
                    or spots. Over 300 varieties of watermelon are available in
                    the U.S., ranging from red to white, and come in different
                    shapes and sizes.

                    Watermelons are enjoyed in all shapes, sizes, and colors on
                    National Watermelon Day. Delightfully sweet and tasty, they
                    are the go-to fruit for summer. No picnic is complete
                    without watermelons. Best enjoyed outdoors,
                    watermelon-eating contests and seed-spitting contests are a
                    tradition. As they consist of 90% water, smoothies,
                    sherbets, cocktails, and other beverages are concocted from
                    watermelons, today, and desserts featuring watermelon as the
                    main ingredient are also prepared.

                    Learning how to pick a ripe watermelon is an art and a
                    tradition. Many people utilize National Watermelon Day as an
                    opportunity to educate themselves or others on how to tell
                    whether a watermelon is ripe.
